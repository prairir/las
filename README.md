# las

**WARNING: these instructions work best on a unix based system**
it may work on windows, hasn't been tested

## Name

ls + cat = las

## Why?

Because its fun. Also I'm so lazy I don't want to retype a command.

## Description

las shows the contents of its arguements. If it's a file, it acts like
`cat` and shows the file contents to the terminal. If it's a directory,
it acts like `ls` and lists all the things inside the directory to the terminal.

## Setup

I'm using zig 0.11.0. Download and use that. It should just work.
